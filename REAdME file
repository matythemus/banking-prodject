< This was a school prodject that based on the persons initial investment, monthly investment, rate, and time that they had to acrue interest it would display how much they would make each year compounded monthly without any of the additional monthly investment and then would also show how much that the person would accrue  with their additional monthly investment
< something that I think that I did well in this prodject was to incorperate the functions well so that main was kept pretty small and did not have a lot going on I also think that with the way that I had all the code that it is easy to read the code
<I am not sure where all I could enhance the code but I know that If I unstood classes better than I could have probably could have minimized the code and made it smaller, I also think that If i had more time to work on this prodject then I could have made the onscreen display a lot more visually appealing than just the words on the screen but have not done that yet. Also I think that it could be fun to make this prodject bigger and take more things into account and also calculate some other different rates and possibilies instead of just with and without a monthly deposit
<from what I remeber about doing this prodject a few weeks ago Thhe part about this prodject that gave me the most trouble was trying to figure out how to calculate the interest monthly and also add the monthly deposit
<I think that from doing this prodject I got better with using and calling functions and trying to minimize main and I think that if I do any other future prodjects that knowing how to use funtions well will help out the other prodjects that I do
<I tried to make the4 program easily readable by trying to comment a lot on the lines and also split up the functions so that it was easy to look at and understand what was going on in the lines of code
